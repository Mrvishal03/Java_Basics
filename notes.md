# A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

# Method: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller. 

# Data Abstraction is the property by  virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or non-essential units are not displayed to the user.  


# Encapsulation: It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates.

#  Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class. We are achieving inheritance by using extends keyword. Inheritance is also known as “is-a” relationship.


# Polymorphism is one of the most important concepts in OOP. It describes the ability of something to have or to be displayed in more than one form.


# Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming languages like Java, C++, and C# that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but with different parameter lists

# When a method in a subclass has the same name, the same parameters or signature, and the same return type(or sub-type) as a method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

# Java has two phases Compile and Run.

# Bytecode is a compile form  of java program.

# JVM is dependent.It depends on the OS Hardware.

# Interprator: The interpreter converts high-level language to an intermediate language. It contains pre-compiled code, source code, etc.

# Hardware Independent: Java program is easily acceptable for all the hardware.

# Robust:

# Garbage Collection:


# Bubble sorts takes n-1 number of steps;


# Collection: 

# Vector is dynamic in nature.
